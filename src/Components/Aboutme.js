              <p className="aboutContent">
                I am an athlete at heart, with an entrepreneurial spirit and a
                passion for coding. I started my career from Infosys as a system
                engineer and worked on various web development projects.
                Initially it was very difficult to uderstand coding for non IT
                guy but as I get familiar to the different technologies I
                started enjoying them and followed my interest in UI
                development.
