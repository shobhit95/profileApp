                  It is the first basic and the most coolest thing I learned

                  I use Bootstrap more often than not when designing the layout
                  for my sites. It is the framework I am most familiar with and
                  can therefore design more quickly.

                <p className="aboutContent">
                  This is the first scripting language I started working and its
                  flexibility to interact with DOM and its continuous
                  advancement makes me more attractive to play with it.

                  When I was new to React and really did not like it at first.
                  It has grown on me though and from hat point I started liking
                  it and enjoying working on it.

                  Since I want to learn server side scripting language so I
                  choose NodeJs and it is really a nice experience with it.

                  I use Heroku as my hosting platform for most of my projects
                  because so far they are all unpaid and their free tier is
                  convenient. I also appreciate its integration with Github for
                  such simple deployment.
